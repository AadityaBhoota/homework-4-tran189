Part 1: Write your message here from GitHub
The FitnessGram Pacer Test is a multistage aerobic capacity test that progressively gets more difficult as it continues. The 20 meter pacer test will begin in 30 seconds. Line up at the start. The running speed starts slowly but gets faster each minute after you hear this signal bodeboop. A sing lap should be completed every time you hear this sound. ding Remember to run in a straight line and run as long as possible. The second time you fail to complete a lap before the sound, your test is over. The test will begin on the word start. On your mark. Get ready!â€¦ Start.

Task 1: 
// Under this line, describe what the command 'git status' do
The "git status" command basically tells you the status of your local repository (as compared to the central repo), particularly whether you are up to date with the central repo or not, how many commits you are behind, what files are tracked, what are untracked, what have been modified, what changes have been staged and what haven't, etc.

Task 2:
// Under this line, describe the difference between Git and GitHub
While there are many other nuances, the fundamental difference between Git and GitHub can be described as so: Git is a version control system, and GitHub is a cloud service that allows you to use Git and manage your Git repositories. Consquently, this also means that GitHub is not your only choice when it comes to using Git as a version control system. If Git was a car engine then GitHub would be the car itself, allowing you to use the engine for your transportation needs.
